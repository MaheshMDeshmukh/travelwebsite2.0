   <h3> 1.Dagduseth Ganpati Mandir</h3>
   <img src="HTML PICTURES/Picture7.jpg">
   <h4>Shrimant Dagadusheth Halwai and his wife Laxmibai was a Lingayat trader and sweet maker from Karnataka and settled in Pune.
        After he gained fame as a halwai, that became his surname. His original halwai shop still exists under the name "Dagdusheth 
        Halwai Sweets" near Datta Mandir in Pune. Eventually he became a successful sweet seller and a rich businessman. In the later 1800s, 
        they lost their two sons (Ram and Lakshman) in a plague epidemic. Later, as they did not have any heir, Dagdusheth adopted his
         nephew Govindsheth (born 1865) who was 9 years old at the time of their death. Govindsheth was born in 1891 in Pune.
        He replaced the first Ganesh idol by a new one, with the first one still being present at Akra Maruti Chowk</h4>
    <h4>
        The temple is a beautiful construction and boasts a rich history of over 100 years. Jay and Vijay, the two sentinels made 
        of marble catch the eye of all at the outset. The construction is so simple that all the proceedings in the temple along with 
        the beautiful Ganesh idol can be seen even from outside. The Ganesh idol is 2.2 metres tall and 1 metrewide. It is adorned with
         nearly 40 kilos of gold. The devotees of Ganesh offer Him gold and money and with every offering the Lord gets richer and
          richer. Moreover, heaps of coconuts offered to the deity are yet another feature of the temple. Daily pooja, abhisheka and
           the arti of Ganesh are worth attending. The lighting of the temple during the Ganesh festival is marvelous.
            Shrimant Dagdusheth Ganpati Trust looks into the maintenance of the temple. The temple is situated in the centre of city,
             local shopping market is also the nearby temple. Various cultural activities like music concerts, bhajans, and 
             Atharvasheersh recitation are organized by the trust.

    <h3> 2.Alandi Mandir</h3>
    <img src="HTML PICTURES/Picture8.jpg" sizes="70px">
 
    <h4>Alandi has a long history but gained prominence in the 13th century when Dnyaneshwar (1275–1296) decided to entomb,
         otherwise known as sanjeevan samadhi, himself in a samadhi, a form of shrine, under the then existing Siddheshwar temple 
         complex in 1296.A temple was built over the Samadhi by Ambekar Deshpande in around 1580–1600. Further additions to the
          temple were made during the Maratha Empire era by Maratha nobles and the Peshwa. In 1778, Alandi was granted to Mahadji
           Shinde, the powerful Maratha statesman of the Maratha confederacy at that time, by the Peshwa. For two decades after that, 
           the Shinde family were the main sponsors of various renovations of the temple. In the 1820s, Haibatraobuva Arphalkar,
            a courtier of the Scindia of Gwalior, started the modern Palkhi tradition of carrying the paduka (sandals) of Dnyaneshwar
             to Pandharpur during the annual Wari. Haibatraobuva was laid to rest under the first step of the temple complex per his 
             will. Despite being a small town, it was granted municipal status during the early British Raj. The council would raise 
             revenue through levying tax on pilgrims which used to number around 50,000 at the end of 19th century.</h4>
