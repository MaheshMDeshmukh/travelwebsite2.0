        <h5>Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park</h5>
        <p style="background-color:FF7BA9;">
          Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park, also known as Katraj Snake Park, is among the popular zoos in India. It is in Katraj,
                only a few kilometres away from Pune. So, it is a favourite among the local people and others who come to
                explore Pune.
                Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park is divided into three sections: the zoo, a lake, and a snake park. It also has a
                wildlife research centre, which serves as an animal orphanage, rescue centre and care centre.
                The Rajiv Gandhi Zoo Park Katraj, you see today, began as the small Peshwe Park in 1953. It was created by
                Pune Municipal Corporation. Later, in 1987, it helped in setting up Katraj Snake Park.
                Best Time to Visit Rajiv Gandhi Zoo Park in Pune
                The best season to visit Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park Pune is monsoon (July – September). The weather
                remains cool and pleasant for your visit. But the untimely rains might disturb you while you explore the
                zoo.
                So, visit this tourist place during winter (November – February). Winters in Pune also are as best as
                monsoon, for the trip.
