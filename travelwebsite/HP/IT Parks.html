</h5>
        <p>
          Lal Mahal is Pune’s historical landmark. Dating its existence back to the 16th century, Lal Mahal
acknowledges the valor of leaders and rulers of Shivaji’s era. It is a symbolic representation that elucidates
the heroic acts that the Peshwas were known for <br>
Lal signifies ‘Red’ whereas mahal denotes ‘palace.’ This is how the monument derived its identity. The
entire palace is an architectural brilliance. The walls built from the red bricks feature the progressive stage
of Shivaji’s life journey <br>
Shivaji’s father, Shahaji Maharaj, was the one who laid the foundation of this Lal Mahal. The main reason to
construct this colossal structure was the quick revival of the miserable condition of Pune <br>
After conquering a few territories, he was enthroned to rule over some Pune territories. This was the time when
he felt necessary to construct a palace for his accommodation.<br>
Eventually, in the year 1630 AD, Lal Mahal stood high with pride. From then, until he acquired Torna Fort in
1645, this was his residential palace.
